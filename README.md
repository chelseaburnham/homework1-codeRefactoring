#   horiseon-codeRefactoring

##  Description
This application was originally created as a social media marketing site. I took this repository and went through the HTML code to clean it up and use semantic elements. After cleaning up the HTML elements, I did the same with CCS and added comments for others to better understand. Some of the challenges were taking the initial code and making sure that the changes I made did not effect the expected outcome. In the future, I hope that by organizing the code, others can go in as needed and spruce up the site more efficiently.
